This is the sinple class that was providing one of the best solution to the reverse proxy stuff using wordpress.
What we did is, we created some settings in wp backend which get list of IP's to whitelist for the request.
We also make sure to white list these IP's on server. and based on that we can serve reverseproxy.
For your understanding, the reverse-proxy is, if you have two servers and wanted to serve through the first server you usually implement reverseproxy. for more details you can maybe goole it.
